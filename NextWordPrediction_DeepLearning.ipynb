We achieved it by creating an empty list which holds our n_gram sequences. Next, we iterate over our corpus of untokenized snippets and apply the “texts_to_sequences” method to each untokenized snippet. The “texts_to_sequences” method converts each snippet to its tokenized version. By calling tokenizer method texts_to_sequences we convert sequences of text to sequences of numbers. The resulting seqences can then be used to generate n_gram sequences. Next, we iterate over each token beginning with the second (index=1) throught all remaining tokens. At each iteration, we append the sequence of n_grams to input_sequences and expand the n_gram+1.\n"

        "Built a model consisting of an embedding layer,( our input layer) 3 LSTM layers, 3 dropout layers, and a fully connected Dense layer. The first layer being the Embedding layer enabled us to utilize the pre-trained GloVe word embeddings coefficients/weights. The embedding layer requires an input_dim of the total number of unique words in our corpus and an output_dim which specifies the number of word embedding dimensions we are waiting. We passed the embeddings_matrix into the weights argument in order to use the GloVe weights and set the trainable argument to “False”, otherwise, we’ll retrain the GloVe weights. Finally, we’ll set the input_length parameter to “max_seq_length -1”..... We used the dropout method for regularization. That means that during training randomly we set some activations to zero in each iteration. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model learns the relationships among words and allows the important relationships to propagate through the network. The LSTM core model contains LSTM cells that processes one word at a time and assigns probabilities of the most possible values for the next word in the sentence. We used a Bidirectional LSTM which learns the relationships among words reading the sentence from left-to-right and right-to-left. We use LSTM instead of RNN, because though RNN can connect past data to the present information; it gives some problem in long term dependencies. Moreover RNN suffer from vanishing and exploiting gradients problem. That is also the reason why we used Rely, an activation functions that don’t “squash” z into a limited range. We added 2 dropout layers (drop 20%) to help with the overfitting problem. We chose Adam as our optimizer and categorical_crossentropy as our loss function, since we have a multi-class classification problem. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) which is adapting the learning rate to particular weights. It uses exponential moving average of the gradient and the square gradient.\n"
